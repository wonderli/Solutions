Question:

Suppose that a dynamic set S is represented by a direct-address table T of length m. Describe a procedure that finds the maximum element of S. What is the worst-case performance of your procedure?

Answer:

S size is m;

	max = undefined
	for i from 0 to m-1
		if(max is undefined or max < T[(h(k) + i) mod m]
			max = T[(h(k) + i) mod m]
		

The Worst Case is O(m)

Question:

A **bit vector** is simply an array of bits (0s and 1s). A bit vector of length m takes much less space than an array of m pointers. Describe how to use a bit vector to represent a dynamic set of distinct elements with no satellite data. Dictionary operations should run in O(1) time.
